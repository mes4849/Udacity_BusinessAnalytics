## Overview:
A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a large set of diamonds, but is unsure how much it should bid. This project will use the results from a predictive model to make recommendations on how much the jewelry company should bid for the diamonds.

Ex - $1.25 is 1 and a 1/4 dollars, or 1 dollar and 25 cents.


## Project Details:
Provided with linear regression model built from large database of diamonds, their price, and attributes  
Tasked with applying the linear regression model to make a reccomendation for a bid on a 3,000 diamon piece set.  
Linear regression model provides the following equation:  
  'Price = -5269 + 8413*Carat + 158.1*Cut + 454*Clarity'  

#### Data
There are two data sets:
1. 'diamonds.csv' - contains the data used to build the model  
2. 'new_diamonds.csv' - contains the data for the diamonds the company would like to purchase
