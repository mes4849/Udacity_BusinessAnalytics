## Project: Predicting Diamond Prices
See folder for project description, below are general notes

#### Creating a Predictive Model
- Training set (training data): data where the outcome is already known
	- This data will include predictor and outcome / target variables
	- Training data helps model understand relationship between predictor variables and outcome varaibles
- Test set (test data): dataset where the outcomes are not yet known
	- This set contains all the predictor data, but not the outcome varaibles(s)
	- We apply the model to this dataset to predit outcomes
